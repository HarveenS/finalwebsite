					<h3>Book 2-SECOND HEARTS</h3>
					<p>Charli Blake's high tolerance for risk doesn't always work in her favour.
After a year of living out her dream of travelling the world, the sunny West African village of Kaimte would be her last stop.
She's bound for New York, in search of the boy she'd let go of long ago.
But reality soon hits hard.
For Adam, everything has changed.</p>
