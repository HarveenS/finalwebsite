			<h3>Book 1-SAVING WISHES</h3>

				<br> For Charli Blake, being seventeen is a tough gig. She's been branded a troublemaker, her reputation is in tatters and she's stuck in Pipers Cove, a speck of a town on the coast of Tasmania. Thankfully, it's temporary.</p>

			<h3>Book 2-SECOND HEARTS</h3>
			<p>Charli Blake's high tolerance for risk doesn't always work in her favour. After a year of living out her dream of travelling the world, the sunny West African village of Kaimte would be her last stop. She's bound for New York, in search of the boy she'd let go of long ago. But reality soon hits hard. For Adam, everything has changed.</p>

			<h3>Book 2-SAND JEWELS</h3>
			<p>Gabrielle Décarie was over arrogant men – but that didn’t mean she couldn’t have a little fun with one. When she took a chance on Alex Blake, it was supposed to be a one-night deal. He was too cocky, too flirty and too complicated.</p>
